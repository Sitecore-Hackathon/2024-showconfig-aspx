Description
⟹ Our project addresses the challenge of automating the generation of TypeScript (TS) files for Sitecore JSON renderings using Gemini AI. By harnessing the power of PowerShell (PS) scripting and Gemini AI technology, we've developed a feature that simplifies the creation of TS files tailored specifically for Sitecore JSON renderings in NEXT.js. This innovative tool streamlines the development process for Sitecore developers, eliminating the manual effort involved in crafting TS interfaces for JSON data structures. With our solution, developers can now seamlessly integrate Sitecore JSON renderings into TypeScript projects, enhancing productivity and reducing errors. Whether you're building websites, applications, or digital experiences with Sitecore, our feature empowers you to effortlessly leverage JSON data within your TypeScript codebase. Experience the future of Sitecore development with our Sitecore JSON Rendering TypeScript Generator!
